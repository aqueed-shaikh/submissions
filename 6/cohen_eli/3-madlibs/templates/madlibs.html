<h3>Story 1 (By Frankie Li) :</h3>
<br>
{{d.name}} is the most {{d.adj}} person in the kingdom of {{d.adj1}} {{d.noun1}}. The {{d.adj}} {{d.name}} was once the {{d.adj2}} peasant of the kingdom of {{d.adj3}} but after he slayed the {{d.noun2}} he was crowned the most {{d.adj4}} ruler.  He was given many {{d.noun3}} as well as {{d.noun4}} until he was sick of all the things that they gave him.  Being the most {{d.adj5}} ruler, he was expected to be {{d.adj5}}.

<h3>Story 2 (By Eli Cohen):</h3> 

One day {{d.name}} was going to his school, {{d.school}}, located in {{d.place1}}. However, on the way there, he was attacked by a {{d.adj}} {{d.noun}}. The {{d.noun}} managed to rip off {{d.name}}'s {{d.bodypart}}, injuring him. However {{d.name}} was still able to kill the {{d.noun}} by {{d.verb}}ing it with his {{d.noun1}}. In order to heal his wounds, {{d.name}} went to the {{d.place}}. Unfortunately, when he got there he saw that it was replaced by a {{d.adj1}} {{d.place2}}. This made him so {{d.adj2}} that he wanted to {{d.verb1}} a {{d.noun2}}. Soon he became even more {{d.adj2}} when he realized that he was late for school. He quickly made his way over to {{d.school}} by riding the {{d.noun3}}, but he was still late for his 1st period {{d.noun4}} class with the {{d.adj}} teacher Mr. {{d.name1}}. Soon {{d.name}} was explaining to Mr. {{d.name1}} why he was late, and even showed him his missing {{d.bodypart}}. However Mr. {{d.name1}} didn't believe him and became so {{d.adj3}} that he took a {{d.noun4}} and {{d.verb2}}ed {{d.name}}'s {{d.bodypart1}}. He then told {{d.name}} to go to his seat, take out his {{d.noun5}}, and copy down the aim. The lesson that day was about {{d.place3}}'s invasion of {{d.place4}}. However, {{d.name}} couldn't concentrate because of his missing {{d.bodypart}}. However, in the end this didn't turn out to be very important because a message on the loadspeaker announced that {{d.place3}} had begun invading {{d.place1}}, and decided to {{d.verb3}} it. As a result, everbody died.
