<h1>RANDOM MADLIBS</h1>

<h2>By Eli Cohen and Simon Chen</h2>

<b>One day <<d.name>> was going to his school, <<d.school>>, located in <<d.place1>>. However, on the way there, he was attacked by a <<d.adj>> <<d.noun>>. The <<d.noun>> managed to rip off <<d.name>>'s <<d.bodypart>>, injuring him. However <<d.name>> was still able to kill the <<d.noun>> by <<d.verb>>ing it with his <<d.noun1>>. In order to heal his wounds, <<d.name>> went to the <<d.place>>. Unfortunately, when he got there he saw that it was replaced by a <<d.adj1>> <<d.place2>>. This made him so <<d.adj2>> that he wanted to <<d.verb1>> a <<d.noun2>>. Soon he became even more <<d.adj2>> when he realized that he was late for school. He quickly made his way over to <<d.school>> by riding the <<d.noun3>>, but he was still late for his 1st period <<d.noun4>> class with the <<d.adj>> teacher Mr. <<d.name1>>. Soon <<d.name>> was explaining to Mr. <<d.name1>> why he was late, and even showed him his missing <<d.bodypart>>. However Mr. <<d.name1>> didn't believe him and became so <<d.adj3>> that he took a <<d.noun4>> and <<d.verb2>>ed <<d.name>>'s <<d.bodypart1>>. He then told <<d.name>> to go to his seat, take out his <<d.noun5>>, and copy down the aim. The lesson that day was about <<d.place3>>'s invasion of <<d.place4>>. However, <<d.name>> couldn't concentrate because of his missing <<d.bodypart>>. However, in the end this didn't turn out to be very important because a message on the loadspeaker announced that <<d.place3>> had begun invading <<d.place1>>, and decided to <<d.verb3>> it. As a result, everbody died.
