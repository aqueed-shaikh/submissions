Once upon a time in a magical place known as %(place1)s, there lived two legends known as %(name1)s and %(name2)s.  
%(name1)s was a very %(adjective1)s fellow and enjoyed %(verbING1)s on the weekends, whereas
%(name2)s had more %(adjective2)s tastes, and could often be found %(verbING2)s at night.
Differences aside, the two were both quite %(adjective3)s and you could always count on the %(verbING3)s together every day.
However one day when the two were supposed to be %(verbING3)s, %(name1)s didn't show up.  %(name2)s tried calling but to no avail.  
Later that night when %(name2)s was busy %(verbING2)s, %(name1)s called back and explained that they couldn't continue %(verbING3)s together any more.
%(name1)s had moved on and now would only be %(verbING4)s with %(name3)s who was much better in all aspects, especially being much more %(adjective4)s.
%(name2)s was sad and went to the corner to cry, and later died.
