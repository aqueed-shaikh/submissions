    <h2 style="text-align:center">{{name1}}'s Epic Journey</h2>

    <p> Once upon a time, {{title1}} {{name1}} was an aspiring Pokemon trainer from
      {{location1}}. As a {{adjective1}} 10 year old, {{pronoun1}} was 
      eager to see the world outside {{location1}}. </p>
    
    <p>On a {{adjective2}} day, {{name1}} woke up late, and had to {{verb1}} over 
      to the Pokemon lab. Unfortunately, {{title2}} {{name2}}, the childhood rival,
      stole {{name1}}'s favorite Pokemon, {{pokemon1}}. With no other
      choice, {{pronoun1}} had to take the last Pokemon, {{pokemon2}}. </p> 
    
    <p>{{pokemon2}} was a {{adjective3}} Pokemon, and {{name1}} promptly named
      the {{pokemon2}} {{nickname1}}. However, {{pronoun2}} was merely level
      {{level1}}. {{name1}} wasn't very pleased with {{nickname1}} and {{pronoun1}}
      would spend days trying to teach {{nickname1}} how to {{verb2}} in 
      {{location2}}.</p>
    
    <p>One {{adjective4}} morning, {{name1}} bumped into {{name2}} in
      {{location3}}. The two of them wanted to have a {{adjective5}} Pokemon
      battle. When {{name2}} sent out {{nickname2}}, a level {{level2}}
      {{pokemon1}}, {{nickname1}} was {{adverb1}} defeated.</p>
    
    <p>{{name1}} was so depressed by the defeat that {{pronoun1}} tried to
      {{verb3}} {{adverb2}}. It didn't work. In the end, {{pronoun1}} {{pastverb}}
      outside of {{location4}}, waiting to {{verb4}} {{title3}} Red. {{nickname1}}
      still sucked.</p>
