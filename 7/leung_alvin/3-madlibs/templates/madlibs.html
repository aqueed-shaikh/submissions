<h1>Madlibs</h1>


Our whole {{noun1}} was in a {{adj1}} {{adj2}} state,
Then {{adverb1}} fourteen billion {{noun2}} ago expansion started. Wait...
The Earth began to cool,
The {{noun3}} began to {{verb1}},
Neanderthals developed {{noun4}},
We {{verb2}} a wall (we built the pyramids),
Math, science, {{noun5}}, unraveling the mysteries,
That all started with the {{adj3}} bang!

Since the dawn of man is {{adverb2}} not that {{adj4}},
As {{adj5}} galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to {{verb3}} this song.
A fraction of a second and the elements were made.
The bipeds stood up {{adj5}},
The dinosaurs all met their fate,
{{pro1}} tried to leap but {{pro1}} were late
And {{pro1}} died ({{pro1}} froze their {{noun6}} off)
The oceans and Pangea
See ya wouldn't wanna be ya
Set in motion by the same big {{noun7}}!

It all started with the big BANG!

It's expanding ever outward but one day
It will pause and start to go the other way,
Collapsing ever inward, we won't be here, it won't be heard
Our best and {{adj6}} figure that it'll make an even {{adj7}} bang!

{{name1}} would {{adverb3}} have been sick of {{pro2}}
Debating how we're here, they're catching deer (we're catching viruses)
Religion or astronomy ({{name2}} or Deuteronomy)
It all started with the big bang!

Music and mythology, {{name3}} and astrology
It all started with the big bang!
It all started with the big BANG!
